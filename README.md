# React State Management Examples

This project demonstrates various state management approaches in React, helping developers understand different tools and when to use them.

## Branch Purpose: `challenge/fe-state-managements`

This branch is dedicated to exploring and comparing different state management solutions in React:

- **Context API**: For sharing global state across components without prop drilling
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: For managing server state, caching, and data fetching
- **Redux** (coming soon): For complex application state with predictable updates
- **Zustand** (coming soon): For lightweight, simple global state management

Each example includes detailed documentation and interactive demos via Storybook.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run Storybook to view examples:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

This will start Storybook at `http://localhost:6006` where you can explore interactive examples of each state management approach.

## Future Updates

- **React Hooks Examples**: Demonstrations of core hooks including `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and custom hooks
- **Redux Integration**: Complete Redux setup with Redux Toolkit
- **Zustand Examples**: Simple global state management patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Examples of state optimization techniques
